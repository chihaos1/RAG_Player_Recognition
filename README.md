# Player Image Recognition (with RAG)

A lightweight implementation of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipline that centers on facial recognition of football player. 


## Project Description

The project takes users through the full lifecyle â€” from scraping player images from Getty Images, generating face embeddings with DeepFace and storing them in Pinecone, to querying the system with a new image to identify the player. 

The backend of the project is built with **FastAPI**, where each endpoint is connected to a dedicated module for scraping, embedding, and querying. On the frontend, the interface is rendered by **React** to allow users to upload images and receive real-time identification results through API calls to the backend. 

The project uses **Pinecone** to manage the image embeddings. When a user submits an image query, the system retrieves the most similar embedding from the vector store. The result of the query, which will be a player's name, is then sent to **ChatGPT** to generate a brief description of the player.

### API Endpoints
1. [`/scrape`](#) : User selects a team and specifies the number of images per player. Upon submission, the system scrapes and stores the corresponding images in the backend.
2. [`/embed`](#): Vectorizes the scraped images into embeddings and stores them in Pinecone for similarity search. 
3. [`/query`](#): The user uploads an image of a player. The system retrieves the most similar embedding from Pinecone, identifies the player, and returns a brief description generated by ChatGPT.
